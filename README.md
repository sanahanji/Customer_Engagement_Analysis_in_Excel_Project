# Customer_Engagement_Analysis_in_Excel_Project
Analyze student engagement data from the 365 platform to evaluate the impact of new features like XP systems, leaderboards, and expanded course libraries. The project includes descriptive statistics, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing to assess engagement trends and provide actionable insights for improvement.

# Introduction

The 365 Company revolutionized its platform in 2022 with features like an XP system, in-app rewards, leaderboards, and a streak tracker to improve student engagement. Alongside expanding its course library, these efforts aimed to enhance learning consistency and attract a broader user base. This project explores the effectiveness of these strategies through a detailed customer engagement analysis using Excel. By examining student behavior through descriptive statistics, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing, we assess the impact of these features on engagement.

# Methodology
The analysis used anonymized data covering Q4 2021 and Q4 2022. Key metrics included minutes watched by paid- and free-plan students. The process involved the following steps:
1. Descriptive Statistics:  Understanding central tendencies (mean, median), variability (standard deviation), and distribution patterns (skewness, kurtosis) to explore engagement trends.
2. Confidence Intervals: Estimating the range for average minutes watched to assess changes in engagement over time.
3. Hypothesis Testing: Conducting statistical tests to validate the significance of observed changes between:
   * Engagement in 2021 vs. 2022.
   * US and Indian student engagement.
The analysis was performed using Excel’s Data Analysis ToolPak, with results summarized in corresponding spreadsheets.

# Results and Insights

1. Descriptive Analysis:
  * Paid-Plan Students:
      * Average minutes watched increased from 33.80 (2021) to 273.02 (2022).
      * Engagement variability (standard deviation) rose from 28.21 to 854.58, indicating broader user behavior diversity.
  * Free-Plan Students:
      * Mean engagement increased from 25.39 (2021) to 117.64 (2022), but the median dropped from 14.17 to 11.83, highlighting disengagement among typical free-plan users.
  * Skewness and Kurtosis:
      * Positive skewness and high kurtosis in both groups reflect outliers (highly engaged students), with paid-plan students showing more balanced engagement.

2. Confidence Intervals:
    * Paid students’ average engagement increased significantly (confidence interval: 316.25–348.76 minutes in 2021 to 351.91–384.72 minutes in 2022).
    * Free-plan engagement declined (confidence interval: 129.92–137.95 minutes in 2021 to 67.71–70.59 minutes in 2022).
    * Paid students consistently outperformed free students, with a widening gap in engagement levels.

3. Hypothesis Testing:
  * 2021 vs. 2022:
      * Paid students showed significant engagement growth (p-value < 0.05).
      * No statistically significant change in free-plan students’ engagement (p-value > 0.05).
  * US vs. India:
      * Indian students watched more content than US students (p-value < 0.05), suggesting higher platform relevance in the Indian market.

# Conclusions

The analysis reveals that paid-plan students significantly benefited from the platform upgrades, demonstrating higher engagement levels and a broader range of activity. Free-plan students showed mixed results, with some highly engaged users pulling up the averages but a decline in median engagement. Regional differences further underscore the need for tailored strategies to boost engagement, especially in markets like the US.
